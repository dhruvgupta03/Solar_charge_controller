# Solar_charge_controller
A PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) solar charge controller is a device used in photovoltaic power systems to control the charging and discharging of batteries.The primary function of a PWM solar charge controller is to regulate the voltage and current coming from the solar panels to the batteries. This is important because the voltage output of solar panels fluctuates depending on sunlight intensity, temperature, and other factors.<br>
PWM charge controllers also provide various protection features to safeguard the batteries from overcharging, over-discharging, short-circuiting, and reverse polarity. These protections help prolong the life of the batteries and ensure safe operation of the entire solar power system. </br><br>
